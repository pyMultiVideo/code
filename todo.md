# Todo

> BAR IS LOW FOR IT TO BE HELPFUL. BASIC FUNCTIONALITY IS MOST IMPORTANT

## IPython Tab (for debugging the state of the variables when using the app)

- [ ] embed ipython in the ipython tab
- [ ] Create a function for creating / recreating the camera information
- [ ] Will there be a function that saves out and replaces csv with another csv with the updated information on closing?

## ViewFinder

- multi cam test 

## Encoder Settings

- [ ] Implementation of settings of the encoder. (There will be a difference between the encoder that will be running and the encoder that will next be run. )
  - [ ] Implement an visual way of indicating which encoder is being used to compress video 
  - [ ] This problem will also exit for the camera setting for current recording vs the camera for the furure reocrding


Testing just the camera instanceiation view finder in a new tab to beginwith
