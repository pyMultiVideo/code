# Camera API implementation

- This folder has not been implemented into the main gui.
- Eventually, for more user compatibility, there can be different types of cameras that do not use pyspin.
- In that case, we need do use generic versions of the functions. These function names are what the wrapper is for.

- Note that the `camera` class will need to be generated by a `system` class which will generate a list of the correct length (the number of cameras). I don't know how exactly to implement this.
